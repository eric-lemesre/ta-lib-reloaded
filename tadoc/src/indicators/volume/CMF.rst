Short description

Description
-----------
The Chaikin Money Flow indicator is a volume indicator that helps in measuring the amount 
of Money Flow Volume over a particular period.

Chaikin Money Flow adds Money Flow Volume for a particular look-back period, typically 20 or 21 days. 
This indicator fluctuates above/below the zero line similarly like an oscillator.

According to this indicator, when the closing price is near to the high then more accumulation takes place. Similarly when the closing price is near to the low then more distribution takes place.

* A CMF value above the zero line signals strength in the market whereas a value below the zero line signals weakness in the market.
* One should wait for the CMF to confirm the breakout direction of price action, for example
  , if a price breaks upward through resistance, then one should wait for the CMF to have a positive value for confirming the breakout direction.
* A CMF sell signal occurs when price makes higher high into overbought zones, with the CMF diverging with a lower high which is known as negative divergence.
* A CMF buy signal occurs when price makes a lower low with the CMF diverging with a higher low with positive divergence.
