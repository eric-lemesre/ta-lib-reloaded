Description
-----------

The Volume RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a volume indicator which is similar to the Relative Strength Index 
except that up-volume and down-volume are used in the formula of RSI instead of changes in price.

Volume RSI oscillates around 50% center-line in the range from 0 to 100%.

One of the ways of using this volume indicator would be to trade on the signals generated on the 
crossovers of the indicator and 50% center-line around which it oscillates.

* When the Volume RSI reading is above 50% then it is considered bullish indicating bullish
  volume dominates over bearish volume.
* When the Volume RSI reading is below 50% then it is considered as bearish indicating bearish
  volume dominates overbullish volume.
