Description
-----------
The Negative Volume Index (NVI) is a cumulative indicator which uses the change 
in volume for deciding when the smart money is active.

This indicator works under the assumption that the smart money is active on 
days when volume decreases and the not-so-smart money is active on days when volume increases.
