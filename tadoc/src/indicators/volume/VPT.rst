Description
-----------

The volume price trend (VPT) indicator is a volume indicator that helps in determining 
a stock’s price direction and also the strength of price change.

The indicator consists of a cumulative volume line that adds or subtracts a multiple 
of the percentage change in a share price’s trend and current volume, that is based on the security’s upward or downward movements.

This indicator is similar to the on-balance volume (OBV) indicator i.e. it measures 
cumulative volume and also provides traders with information about a security’s money flow.

The interpretations of the VPT can be summed up as follows:

* An increase in price and volume confirms the price trend upward.
* A decrease in price and volume confirms the price trend downward.
* An increase in price accompanied by a decreasing or flat volume trend
  is a negative divergence suggesting that the downward price movement is weak and may reverse.
* A decrease in price accompanied by an increasing or flat volume trend
  is a positive divergence suggesting that the upward price movement is weak and may reverse.
