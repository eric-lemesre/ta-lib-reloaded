Indicators type
===============

Technical indicators are mathematical formulas based on the study of prices and/or volumes allowing to take advantage of a market situation.
They make it possible to visualize graphically the evolution of the speed and the quality of a movement over a given period. Stock market indicators allow
to predict the future evolution of prices. These are valuable decision-making tools when you know how to use them. It is important to understand
their operation in order to then be able to optimize the settings and make the indicator efficient. There is no miracle stock market indicator, only
technical indicators that we use well or badly.

Each has its qualities and its defects. Some indicators are better in a directional market while others will be better at identifying reversals.

There are different types of technical indicators in the stock market :

* **Momentums indicators** :
    They translate force and speed of movement. They make it possible to identify a slowdown in the buying/ selling current
    and warn of a possible short-term market correction/reversal. These indicators offer poor buy/sell signals
    and therefore should be used to detect divergences with the price curve.

* **Oscillators indicators** :
    Oscillators can be bounded or not. They identify areas of tension between buyers and sellers
    that could lead to a short-term correction/reversal. Most traders use these indicators for their overbought/oversold areas
    while they offer poor results. Oscillators are relevant leading indicators mainly in a non-directional market
    or for detecting divergence in a directional market.

* **Trends indicators** :
    They reflect the dynamics of the market and mainly its speed. They allow to identify the current trend
    and determine support/resistance levels. The trader can thus set price targets or place protective stops.
    These indicators perform very well in a directional market but perform poorly in a volatile or sideways moving market.

* **Volatility indicators** :
    They reflect the nervousness and indecision present in the market. They make it possible to measure the degree of risk.
    The greater the volatility, the greater the risk. These indicators do not give buy/sell signals but show excesses.
    It is these excesses that can be exploited by the trader in all market conditions.

* **Volumes indicators de volume** :
    They reflect the strength of the movement and the psychology of investors. The larger the volumes, the more meaningful the movement.
    Conversely, low volumes indicate that the movement is running out of steam and a probable correction. Volume indicators must be analyzed
    with the price chart, on their own, they mean nothing. These indicators can be used both in a directional market
    than in a trend less market.
